### ABOUT ME

Worked in a public non-governmental organization that provides legal assistance to refugees and stateless persons as the legal consultant (during 2 years) and later as Protection Monitoring Coordinator (3,5 years).

In April 2022 I had to quit my job and leave my home country. So I received extra free time and I decided to learn JavaScript and Frontend Development.

I know that I can become an excellent JavaScript/Frontend Developer, because I have high ability for self-education and I know my goal.
